# draft-schedulers

Tentative IETF drafts on schedulers for multipath transport

This is work in progress. Travis has been configured to verify:
- the spelling (see the .spelling file if you need to add specific words to the dictionnary)
- the build of the Internet drafts

Please ensure that the CI tests continue to succeed everytime you submit a pull request.
